# Assembly & Installation

### 1. The Enclosure Assembly 📦

Your kit comes with a protective box. Electronics hate water, and since this device lives next to your plants, we need to shield the "Brain" (ESP8266) from accidental splashes.

**Step 1: Secure the Electronics**

1. Take the **Mounting Board** (the flat plate).
2. Peel the adhesive backing off your Breadboard and stick it firmly to the center of the mounting plate.
3. Use a small dab of hot glue or double-sided tape to secure the **Relay Module** next to the breadboard. *Make sure no metal pins from the relay touch the other parts.*

**Step 2: Cable Management**

1. Pass the **Power Adapter cable** through the side slot of the box and plug it into your breadboard power module.
2. Pass the **Pump Wire** and **Sensor Wires** out through the front slots.
3. Gently tuck the excess jumper wires inside the box. Ensure no wires are pulled tight.
4. Snap the lid onto the box.

> 💡 Pro Tip: Use a zip-tie to bundle the wires coming out of the box. This prevents them from being yanked out if someone trips over them.

### 2. The 3-Way Water System 💧

Your kit includes a special 3-way connector. This allows one single pump to water multiple plants at once.

1. Connect the output of the **Water Pump** to the main input of the 3-Way Splitter using the vinyl tubing.
2. Cut three smaller pieces of tubing and connect them to the three outputs of the splitter.
3. **Important:** Try to keep all three tubes the same length. If one tube is much shorter, water will take the easy path and only water that one plant!

### 3. Real-World Installation 🌻

Now, let's take it to the plants.

**1. Positioning**

- Place the **Water Bucket** on the floor.
- Place the **Enclosure Box** on a shelf or table *above* the water level. (This prevents water from siphoning back into the box if the pump fails).
- Place the **Soil Sensor** into the soil of your most "sensitive" plant. Push it in until the gold contacts are almost buried.

**2. Calibration in Soil**
Soil is different from a cup of water. You might need to adjust the sensor sensitivity.

1. Power up the system.
2. Look at the tiny lights on the **Soil Sensor Module**.
3. **If the soil is dry** but the pump isn't running -> Turn the blue potentiometer dial **Clockwise** until the LED on the module lights up and the pump starts.
4. **If the soil is wet** but the pump is still running -> Turn the dial **Counter-Clockwise** until the pump stops.

### 4. Safety & Maintenance

- **Refill the Tank:** Don't let the pump run dry. Check your water bucket every few days.
- **Sensor Corrosion:** Over months, the metal prongs on the soil sensor might corrode (turn green). If this happens, clean them with sandpaper or replace the sensor input.
